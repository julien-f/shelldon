- Improve the "cd" command to allow no arguments (change current directory to
  "~"). (Done)

- Improve the "cd" command to allow to move with the previous directory (cd -).

- Add "pushd" and "popd" commands such as in Bash.

- A config directory which respects XDG spec:
  http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/ (almost done, to
  improve).

- Set internal environment variables such as SHELL, etc.

- Improve the quitting sequence:
  * loop break, end of the main function;
  * SIGTERM handling;
  * stop readline with "rl_done = 1;".

- Improve architecture.

- Poblems with readline when the prompt contains non-visible characters.

- Implement a char *get_cwd() function which returns a string copy (because it
  might change at any moment) of the cwd.
